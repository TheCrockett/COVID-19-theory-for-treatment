* *Disclaimer*: I am not a Medical Doctor, Nurse or otherwise involved in providing healthcare to patients. 

* *Audience*: Medical Doctors, Nurses, Medical Research Scientists and Health Educators, 

* *Intent*: To articulate a potential solution to the COVID-19 crisis around the globe, and applying a vast engineering background to a current problem. 

* *Contributions*: Contributions, will absolutely be accepted VIA pull requests (including shooting down my theory), and I will try and capture as much discussion/facts outside of this as I can (for those not familiar with github). Please create an issue for discussion and I will attempt to keep them in sync. 

## Overview

Periodic application of food-grade ethanol via nebulizer potentially assisting in destruction of virus particles and subsiquently decreasing infection thus weakening the potentially lethal immune system overreaction thus elevating recovery possibility

## Theory

### ***Baseline Assumptions***
* Ethanol(Alcohol) has been successfully inhaled in a recreational manner, creating similar non-lethal consequences, however resulting in expected/desired intoxication. 

* Ethanol Inhalation has been used in  the medical community historically in treatment of  pulmonary edema, as well as mitigating withdrawl in alcoholic patients in gastrointestinal surgeries.

* Ethanol as an effective agent in destroying COVID-19 virus particles

More study required against this particular strain, however per the research; beginning at 42.6% (w/w) ethanol is effective within 30 s against SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, ebolavirus, influenza A virus* 

### Principle

Application of Ethanol small quantities at periodic intervals, up to 3x daily should result in a staged disinfection of lung tissue. 

**Specific dosage should be as minimal as possible, suggesting an order of magnitude less than what an alcoholic patient would be given with GI surgery** (TODO: Research into dosage)

If possible, a larger initial dose should be applied to maximize damage to existing virus and prevent patent from deteriorating further. 



### Known Dangers
* Alcohol's known interactions with a wide array of medications
* Human body is unable to reject overdose of Ethanol VIA inhalation as it can with standard ingestion
* Application of Ethanol is likely to create additional inflammation in lung tissue. Caution should be used in patients at ventilator stage, as any temporary degradation of lung function could accelerate onset of negative outcomes including death in an already fatal situation. Care should be considered that lung function is too far degraded to be treated in this manner, and in these cases impending death would be accelerated.




**WARNING:**
DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TRY THIS AT HOME. THIS IS INTENDED TO OFFER AN OUT-OF-THE-BOX PROPOSAL TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY FROM THE ENGINEERING COMMUNITY THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW, AND IS INTENDED IN GOOD FAITH AND BETTERMENT OF HUMANKIND DURING THE CURRENT WORLDWIDE CRISIS.
